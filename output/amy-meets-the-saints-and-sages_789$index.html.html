Wouldn't your child benefit from having them as role models? Wouldn't it empower your child to know that these saints/sages are real people, some of whom are living right now?In "Amy Meets the Saints and Sages, A Young Person's Adventures in Spirituality" your child gets to meet six saints/sages from six different traditions: Islam, Catholicism, Judaism, Native American, Tibetan Buddhism, and Hinduism. Three of the saints/sages are women; three are men. Three are still with us; three have passed on. Your child is introduced to these saints/sages first through a brief but reverent biography. Then second, your child gets to know the saint/sage better through a concrete story. Children love stories and they have a way of sticking to a child for years. And finally, let's make it personal by having the saint/sage and a young person, about your child's age, fictionally interact around the story. It's all fun and engaging for both child and adults.It's for children age 7-12 and is fully illustrated. There is never any attempt to have your child join anything.And, as your child comes to appreciate various religions, a bit more religious tolerance is gained. With that gain a bit more peace has come forth.Find out more at http://www.mychildsprayers.com/amy-me... ...more
